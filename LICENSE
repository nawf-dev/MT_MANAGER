TRADING DISCLAIMER:

This Expert Advisor (EA) is provided as a tool for educational and trading purposes.
Trading foreign exchange (forex) carries a high level of risk and may not be 
suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as 
well as for you.

Before deciding to trade forex, you should carefully consider your investment 
objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that 
you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore 
you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose.

You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, 
and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.

The author of this software is NOT LIABLE for any losses or damages, direct or 
indirect, that may arise from the use of this software. Use at your own risk.
